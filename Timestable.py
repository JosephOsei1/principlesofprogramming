# 1. Give a guess what you think this code is going to do before you run it.
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))   #2. What do you think this line is going to do?


print(f"\nTimes Table for {num}:\n     #3. There is an error on this line can you find it and fix it?     
for i in range(1, 13):                 #4. Any guess as to what this strange line is supposed to do?
    print(f"{num} Ã— {i} = num * i}")  #5. There's an error here too. Try to fix it.
